# apiworkdayscheduler

**Description:** A simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of a typical working day (9amâ€“5pm).

**User Story:** As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner so that I can manage my time effectively. 

**Acceptance Criteria:** 
Given I am using a daily planner to create a schedule...
When I open the planner, then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
When I scroll down, then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm
When I view the time blocks for that day, then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
When I click into a time block, then I can enter an event
When I click the save button for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist
